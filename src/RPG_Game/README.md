This is a mini-project to learn about C# and also to create my own RPG Game. Here is the [link](https://soscsrpg.com/) to the guide that I followed.

To launch the app:

- cd to the `/RPG_Game_UI` directory
- run the command `dotnet build` to build the application
- then `dotnet run` to launch

Dependencies:

- dotnet 7.0.306
